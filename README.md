**Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?**

The app I developed was an inventory management system. Its primary goal was to provide users with a convenient way to track and manage their inventory efficiently. It was designed to address the user needs of businesses and individuals looking for a solution to streamline inventory management, reducing errors and improving organization.

**What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?**

The essential screens and features included a user-friendly login system, a dynamic database shell for creating, deleting, updating, and viewing inventory items, and an optional SMS notification system. The UI designs were user-centered, focusing on simplicity, intuitiveness, and clear navigation. Success lay in creating a visually appealing, easy-to-navigate interface, ensuring users could effortlessly manage their inventory, which was the core need the app aimed to fulfill.

**How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?**

I approached coding systematically, breaking down tasks, documenting my code, and adhering to best practices. Techniques included modular coding, consistent naming conventions, and in-line comments. These practices enhanced code quality and maintainability. These strategies can be applied in the future to ensure efficient, error-free code in upcoming projects.

**How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?**

Testing was a critical part of the development process, conducted through the Android Emulator. It revealed potential issues, ensuring that the app was robust and error-free. Rigorous testing also allowed for identifying and fixing bugs, addressing compatibility issues, and ensuring that the app performed as intended. It is a vital process to guarantee a smooth user experience.

**Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?**

Innovation was required in the user notification system. While planning the SMS feature, overcoming user permission challenges was a critical aspect. Innovatively designing the app to seamlessly continue functioning even if users denied SMS permissions was a key challenge that required creative problem-solving.

**In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?**

I believe my success primarily shone in the database management component of the app. Efficiently creating, updating, deleting, and viewing items in the database demonstrated my knowledge and skills in database management, ensuring a robust core functionality for the app.
